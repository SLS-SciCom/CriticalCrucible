This is my old website that I will be updating in the coming weeks.  
It consists of the following:  
* Decision Tools
* Everyday Wonders
* Research Questions
* Speaking Science

There is also a blog.  

I need to add information about my new book, _**Beyond the Sage on the Stage**_.
>The book is constructed with a clear progression of logic based on a proven educational framework and provides guidance for communication about both uncontroversial and controversial topics. Demonstrating how commonly dispensed communication advice is often counterproductive, Beyond the Sage on the Stage is an innovative toolkit for being understood, fostering trust and genuine connection, and building a foundation for more effective, inclusive communication.
