<h2>Teaching the Tools in Lies, Damned Lies, and Science</h2>
<h3>Lies, Damned Lies, and Science: How to sort through the noise around global warming, the latest health claims, and other scientific controversies</h3>

The tools in the book are relevant to all, but can be approached from different perspectives for different audiences.   In a science course, an appropriate lens is the nature and methods of science, including communication of scientific findings.  For pre-service and in-service teachers, the focus would be on teaching students to reason critically and the pedagogical ramifications.  For journalists, the course would focus on identifying and learning to avoid the common pitfalls in translating scientific ideas for the public.  As a science in society class for all students, the spotlight would be on the arguments being made about contemporary scientific issues and the evidence behind them.</p> <p>The following activities give students the opportunity to apply the tools to new topics.  The activities can be accomplished individually, in small groups, or in a whole class setting.  The jigsaw method is often helpful; that is, different students or groups of students develop expertise on a particular topic, and then these students are responsible for teaching the class what they have learned.  Irrespective of the approach and the setting, students should be given sufficient time to reflect on the issues, as well as the changes in their own understanding over time.  To enhance students' metacognitive skills, they can be asked to document their initial knowledge and perspectives about a topic, and then be encouraged to compare their own initial ideas to their post-curriculum ideas.</p><h4>1.  Progress of Science</h4><p>Dig into a scientific topic that has been in the news recently because of a finding that was questioned by other scientists in the field.  The March 2014 announcement of the discovery of light remnants from the expansion of the early universe, which has since been retracted, is a good case study.  What questions were the researchers trying to answer and why?  What methods did they use?  What did they supposedly discover?  Why was their purported discovery and the announcement controversial?  What has happened since the announcement?  What does this say about how science progresses?</p><h4>2.  Identifying Stakeholders</h4><p><i>Lies, Damned Lies, and Science</i> discusses the categories of stakeholders for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, genetically engineered food, global climate change, and approval of a new drug to treat depression.  Identify the stakeholders for other issues, such as nanotechnology, Cancer MoonShot 2020, and mosquitoes that are genetically engineered to prevent them from spreading malaria.  Who are the stakeholders, and what do they have to gain or lose?</p><h4>3.  Elucidating Tradeoffs</h4><p>The book elucidates the pros and cons of genetically engineered food, and identifies the different types of tradeoffs that cut across this and other issues.  Tradeoffs typically involve the environment, human health and economics.  For some issues, ethical questions arise as well.  Within each type of tradeoff, short-term and long-term risks and benefits may be at odds.  Choose any past or present socio-scientific issue and draw a concept map that illuminates (as relevant) environmental, human health, economic, and ethical tradeoffs.  Indicate which pros and cons within each of these four types are short-term and which are long-term.</p>  <h4>4.  Appropriate Context</h4><p>To assess tradeoffs in a way that is meaningful, they need to be placed in an appropriate context.  The book describes a variety of contexts for considering policies or technologies.  Pick any technology, and place it in its appropriate context.  This could be an historical or geographical context, but it will almost surely involve comparing one technology to others that perform a similar task.  Remember that even if no other comparable technology exists, the risks or drawbacks of a technology still cannot be considered without some point of reference.  What are the risks or drawbacks of not having the technology?  Describe how the introduction of the appropriate context(s) alters the assessment of tradeoffs.</p>  <h4>5. Cause and Coincidence</h4><p>Many studies that show correlations between two things are reported in a way that implies a causal relationship between them.  This is especially prevalent in the reporting of health findings.  Chose a recent health or scientific finding that links two things and that has been widely reported on by different media.  List and compare the headlines of the stories from the various sources.  Are the headlines consistent?  Do they imply something has caused something else?  Find the original research paper (or at least the abstract) on which the headlines are based.  What kind of study was it?  Did the researchers themselves conclude that they had demonstrated a causal relationship?  Did they express any reservations or caveats about their conclusions?</p><h4>6.  Extrapolating Conclusions</h4><p>Studies must be performed on a realistic scale, which means with a select population, within a constrained geographical region, under a subset of possible conditions and for a limited duration.  Examine an original research paper about a health or environmental topic.  What were the study’s constraints with respect to population, geography, condition and time?  Based on these limitations, how broadly can the findings be applied?  What further research would you want to see done to test the applicability of the findings?</p>  <h4>7.  Numbers Game</h4><p>Once students have been introduced to the statistical concepts in Chapter 7, such as elucidating hidden confounding factors, checking for statistical significance and meaningfulness, identifying statistical artifacts, as well as the ways (Chapter 4) of putting numbers into context, select examples of statistically based claims for them to critique.  If the data are misleading, students should suggest better ways to present them.  If the data are presented appropriately, students can suggest ways stakeholders might use the data in a way that is misleading, but not outright false.</p><h4>8.  Society’s Say</h4><p>Predict and then research the costs of specific public health or environmental issues.  Predict how much is spent on research relevant to those particular issues (e.g. basic science of treatments for diseases, types of energy research, environmental remediation), and then look up public spending on the issue and spending trends over time.  As relevant, consider country-wide and world-wide spending.  Use this data to discuss the relationships between science and policy, and how stakeholders other than scientists influence the process of science.</p>   <h4>9.  Logical Pitfalls</h4><p>It is helpful for students to see their own quirks of logic in action.  For example, clicker questions or on-line surveys can determine how many succumb to Gambler’s Fallacy, or reason differently when a loss or costs framing is switched to a gains or benefits framing.  They can also be encouraged to explore these concepts by replicating published studies about reasoning through informal research with friends or family members.  To become more aware of persuasive techniques that exploit people’s reasoning weaknesses, students can collect and share relevant messages from signs, labels and advertisements.</p>        <h4>10.  Putting it all Together</h4><p>In addition to the case studies presented in the final chapter of the book, two capstone activities can help students put the concepts together.  The first is to examine any current topic in the media and, similar to the case studies, apply the tools in the book to reveal the caveats about the conclusions being made.  The second is to pick a socio-scientific issue that is not new, and examine how the coverage of it and the arguments used by proponents and opponents have changed over time.  Global climate change, reproductive technologies, nanotechnology and genetically engineered food are examples that consistently receive media coverage and have for some time.
